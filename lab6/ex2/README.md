# a)
The results of the sonarqube tests before changes are available in the file BeforeChanges.png
As we can see there, the technical debt found was 1h 3min. This means that sonarqube estimates that we would need around 1 hour and 3 minutes to fix all issues found.

# b) 
There were 11 code smells found, only one of them being critical.

# c) / d) 
After fixing the critical one and adding the jacoco plugin, the new results can be seen in the file AfterChangesAndPlugin.png and the coverage can be seen in the file Coverage.png. As we can see, the coverage is 68.1% and there are 14 lines to cover with 8 conditions to cover.
