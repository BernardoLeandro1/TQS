For this exercise I used the same project as the previous exercise.

# a)

The quality gate conditions is available in the file Conditions.png.
These are based on the default conditions, changing only 2 conditions. Added code smells and removed Coverage. I put values of 3 code smells and 5% duplicated lines for the quality gate  on new code created.

# b)

By adding 5 new code smells, as we can see in the file Validation.png, we didn't pass the conditions imposed by the quality gate.
The changes done were adding public to the classes of the tests files.
As we can see in the CodeSmells.png file, it is advised to remove the public modifier from those files.
